                <p>I am a dedicated and passionate programmer with experience in a multitude of languages, and
                    technologies.
                    I first started being interested in programming somewhere around the ages of thirteen where I was
                    first
                    introduced to HTML and CSS by a friend of mine. He explained that I could let my creative juices
                    flow
                    with making websites, and create anything I wanted. I quickly picked it up, only to find I preferred
                    to
                    work on software. I finished school at 16, and then followed that with a couple of years of working.
                    I
                    didn't want to do anything else, just work and make money. However, at the age of 21, I decided that
                    instead of wasting my skills with computers I would do something about it. After spending 4 to 5
                    years
                    working, I needed a change. I signed up to my local college and started the following September,
                    doing
                    Level 3 computing. I got quickly invested into the course and thoroughly enjoyed it, spending
                    countless
                    hours working on assignments to make them the best I could. The act of going to college also
                    re-ignited
                    my love for programming. I picked C# up and starting developing lots of random things. After a
                    couple of
                    months of figuring out the ropes, I decided to set myself a proper project. So, I decided to do a
                    Discord Bot as this implemented some key features such as MySQL, API usage and implementing OOP.
                    These
                    bots are just for responding to certain messages when a user uses a specific prefix at the start of
                    the
                    message. After many hours of thinking, I decided to create a bot that did lots of random things.
                    Random
                    space facts, cat images and much more. CamBot was born, and I immediately started working on him.
                    The
                    only thing with Discord bots that is frustrating sometimes is the need to host the bot somewhere. I
                    decided that I would dive into the deep end and purchase a Raspberry Pi 4 and host it from in my
                    bedroom. I received the package, and started to test and experiment with ways in which to host the
                    bot
                    on there. After many hours, he was finally working. Since then, I have started enjoying writing Java
                    for
                    Minecraft plugins, and therefore, sadly CamBot has not been touched much, only receiving minor
                    updates
                    at any given time.<br><br>

                    Working with Java is fun, but working on a game you love with that language is even more fun. I
                    thoroughly enjoy learning the mechanics of the game and fleshing them out, while also bending the
                    rules
                    to make some really interesting designs! I've learnt a lot through Java such as using MySQL
                    databases
                    with JDBC, SQLite for local storage, YAML configuration files, Apache Maven, and of course, Java. I
                    have
                    since joined a company called Songoda of whom are a premium Minecraft plugin marketplace and I am on
                    the Customer relations team. However, their CEO, Brianna, has taken me under her wing and has
                    been
                    mentoring me weekly, giving me ideas, tips and tricks and teaching me the fundamentals of working
                    with
                    Java in this environment. My goal for working with Java is to end up on the Songoda Marketplace's
                    development team, working alongside Brianna and the rest of the team as well as creating my own
                    independant plugins for other marketplaces such as Spigot and McMarket.<br><br>

                    As mentioned before, I am currently at college studying a level 3 computing course, with hopes to go
                    to
                    University. I am an aspiring Computer Game programmer, with dreams of working on triple-A games
                    after my
                    university course of which is a 4 year sandwich course. I chose a sandwich year in the hopes of
                    getting
                    good experience for after University when I eventually end up in the job market.<br><br>

                    What about a bit about me though? Well, I am 23 years old and have been a gamer for as long as I can
                    remember. I must've been about 8 or 9 years old when I first started having an interest in how games
                    work, how they are made and everything that goes into them, but never took it any further until I
                    was at
                    least 16 where I started to research how to create video games. Over the years I have managed to
                    collect
                    a wide variety of skills and experiences that will stay with me for life. When I was 14, I joined my
                    local Army Cadets and spent a happy 3 years learning skills that would stay with me for time to
                    come.
                    First aid, field-craft, shooting, discipline, respect, and much more. I left as a training Corporal
                    after my family decided to move to Oxford, which is where I currently live. After coming to Oxford,
                    I
                    found a job working for a local school in the after school club. With the experiences I had gained
                    over
                    the years from having 3 younger brothers (Ages 22, 17, and 10), I believed that I would be suited
                    for
                    this job. From here I picked up new experiences such as working with children, food hygiene, child
                    safety and multiple health and safety certificates. I left here after 2 years, and continued my
                    experiences in workplaces after getting a job at Starbucks a week later. Customer service and till
                    training are just a couple of the things I learnt whilst working here. Over the years, whilst
                    working at
                    these places, I have dedicated a lot of my free time to self-teaching myself how to program. Working
                    with C# and Java, and touching on C++ and Python, I aimed to get myself a good understanding of the
                    fundamentals in these languages, with most of my attention being on both C# and Java as I enjoyed
                    writing these languages, and they are similar to use. </p>

                            about it was eye-opening. Now, at the age of 23, I am almost a year into plugin development.

                    the main

                    meals and cocktails and even a couple of dad-jokes sprinkled in! Basically, if it's random, CamBot
                    has it! Alongside lots of random things, he also has some helpful features like the weather,
                    cryptocurrency prices and a scoreboard system so you can compete to be the top user! Written in C#,
                    the bot is built for Discord. With this language comes efficiency and
                    diversity that are a must for projects like these! He currently runs off of a Raspberry Pi 4 in my
                    bedroom!

                <p>MobContracts is a Minecraft plugin built to create epic boss battles, and amazing fight scenes! With
                    the combination of Java, MySQL and SQLite, the code behind this plugin is efficient and executes
                    flawlessly. Firstly, the player starts a contract, with it's boosted stats, and special
                    area-of-effect effects, the player then fights the contract to the death! With a fully functioning
                    reward system, as well as a leaderboard the players have everything they need to be fully
                    competitive! Using Lambda
                    expressions and ternary to create well executed, legible code
                    and the use of a MySQL connection pool called HikariCP allows for fast database connections to
                    ensure maximum efficiency.

                <p>This isn't necessarily a project, but it comes under the experience I have had. I currently work on
                    the Customer relations team, with the intentions of joining the developer team at a later date. In
                    the customer relations position, my main duty is to maintain a positive relationship between Songoda
                    and their customers. Previously, I was a Jr. Support Rep where I would deal with support tickets,
                    and general inquiries about plugins. This gave me extra knowledge on code exceptions, errors and
                    handling them in order to fix the issues. As mentioned in my 'About me' section, their CEO, Brianna,
                    has taken me under her wing to teach me everything she knows in hopes that to eventually enrol me
                    onto the development team, and aide her in creating, bugfixing and generally improving the current
                    plugins.</p>
